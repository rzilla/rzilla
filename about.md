Rzilla aims to be a resource for R users working with big data and open source software. Its activities include:

 - A [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rzilla) for discussion and interaction among practitioners.
 - A [github organization](https://github.com/rzilla) to coordinate development and maintenance of this site and useful packages, unencumbered by demands on copyright assignment -- what you contribute, you own.
 - A [package archive](https://archive.rzilla.org) to simplify the installation of said packages.
 - A wiki or other directory of relevant information (under construction).

## Q & A

### What is the relation between Rzilla and RHadoop?

Many packages that are important to R users working on big data were developed within the RHadoop project, so this is a legitimate question. Here are a few differences:

- Rzilla does not exclusively focus on development. It may also curate information about packages hosted and developed elsewhere, use cases, success stories, disaster stories, host general discussions about R and big data etc.
- Rzilla does not require copyright transfer to a for profit corporation for projects that it hosts, hoping to encourage community contributions.
- Rzilla has shown some activity in the last 6 months.
- Rzilla is not exclusively focused on Hadoop. Anything big data & R is in scope.

That said, I do not speak for the RHadoop project and they may modify their scope and policies at any time.

### Does Rzilla replace or take over other projects or efforts?

Not necessarily and not as a first option. Rzilla would like to be a point of contact for R/big data/open source practitioners and an entry point into this environment and discussions and activities should not be limited to projects hosted by the Rzilla github organization.

### Who's working on Rzilla

Rzilla is the brainchild of Antonio Piccolboni, a former developer on the RHadoop project and main author of the rmr2 package. Antonio is an experienced consultant and is [available](mailto:antonio@piccolboni.info) for big data/data science related projects.
