Unlike dplyr, tidyr never had a system of backends. But big data needs tidying as much as small data. So I am happy to announce that the new package [tidyr.big](https://github.com/rzilla/tidyr.big) provides the first two backends for tidyr, Hive and SparkSQL. May your big data be squeaky tidy from now on. Itâ€™s still experimental software: check it out with a grain of salt.
